It essentially tracks International Development Finance, i.e. who gave how much aid to who and for what. Parts of the data is questionable (as is to be expected from what I assume is a consolidation from disparate sources, some even paper-based). I was primarily interested in the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **The flow of money from donors to recipient countries**\n",

The fields are similar in both versions. It tracks 67 variables associated with development finance projects as it pertains to 96 donors (countries and organizations like UN, etc.). The fields that I ended up using were:\n",
